In this folder is the main solution for the Anwendungsforschungsprojekt exercise and this model is created in the progress.
During the creation of the model with over 100 houses the generation script was updated and refactored several times. That's why this folder structure is not up to date.
A more lightweight folder structure can be found under "Test Models/Generated Test Model". Thus this model should only used for analysis purposes.
It may be started with the command "gridlabd Berlin_Gridlabd_Model_NR.glm --profile" in the terminal.
