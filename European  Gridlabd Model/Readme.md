In this folder is a big european model which may be simulated with gridlabd.

There are 3 categories of files:

1. player files:
    Player files are input files which contain real kW/h values from real houses to make the model more realistic.

2. strom files:
    strom files are output files which are generated from houses in the simulation.
3. gridLAB_D_Model.glm 
    the actual european model. It may be started with the command "gridlabd gridLAB_D_Model.glm --profile" in the terminal.
